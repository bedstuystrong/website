Bed-Stuy Strong is a group of neighbors helping neighbors in a spirit of solidarity. We are a mutual aid network of over 4,000 people from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting our community during the COVID-19 crisis. We crowdsource donations and use them to provide no-contact grocery deliveries for vulnerable members of our Bed-Stuy communities.

All of our members are ordinary folks volunteering their time and effort. We are not a government agency or a non-profit. You can [learn more about our guiding principles here](/principles).

Given the times, Bed-Stuy Strong faces an incredible amount of need in our community. Every day we receive hundreds of calls. We spend several thousand dollars daily to try to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. We ask for your patience and support as we try to connect our community’s help to our community’s need.

## I am in need.

If you live in Bed-Stuy and are experiencing hunger, please leave us a voicemail or send a text message to [917-451-5522](tel:9174515522). We will call you back to coordinate a no-contact delivery of essential groceries or medical supplies.

Our thoughts are with you. We apologize that we can’t meet your request immediately. We have received thousands of messages and respond in the order that requests are received, so there is no need to leave multiple voicemails.

Please go to [NYC.gov/getFood](http://nyc.gov/getFood) if you are experiencing hunger right now.

### A detailed list of food assistance options in Bed-Stuy and citywide is available here: [bedstuystrong.com/resources](/resources)

## I want to donate.

One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for vulnerable neighbors. Households then receive what they need from our network of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed-Stuy residents who are looking to help members of their community.

We are grateful for every contribution. Every dollar you give has a direct impact on the safety and well-being of our Bed-Stuy neighbors. Since our founding in March, Bed-Stuy Strong purchased and delivered a week’s supply of groceries for over 17,800 neighbors, providing an estimated 375,000 meals. 85% of the neighbors we've served are elderly, immunocompromised, or disabled.

## I want to help.

We need more neighbors to help answer our phones and run deliveries to those in need. If you’re interested in joining us, please [send us an email at bedstuystrong+slack@bedstuystrong.com](mailto:bedstuystrong+slack@bedstuystrong.com). We appreciate your support.

Beyond our mutual aid operation, our online Slack community is also a place for neighbors to connect, share information, organize virtual events, and more. In an age of social distancing, Bed-Stuy Strong believes in the power of staying connected as a community.

## I’m interested in partnering.

As unemployment and economic hardship continues to grow due to the COVID-19 crisis, we are continuing to evolve to ensure we can continue supporting our neighbors in need. As part of this evolution, we are exploring potential partnerships with Brooklyn-based organizations and businesses that have expertise in food provision and distribution and access to physical space. If you’re interested in discussing partnership opportunities, please email us at [partnerships@bedstuystrong.com](mailto:partnerships@bedstuystrong.com).
