### Delivery options for those who cannot leave their homes safely at the moment

#### NYC Food Delivery Assistance

*   The City of New York is providing assistance to New Yorkers during the COVID-19 crisis by delivering free meals to those who cannot access food themselves. This service is intended for individuals and families who meet all of the following criteria as a result of the COVID-19 emergency:
*   No members of the household can go out and get food because they are at increased medical risk or homebound
*   No neighbors or family members can go out and get food for you
*   Do not receive meal assistance from other providers (incl. Meals on Wheels or God's Love We Deliver); and
*   You are unable to afford meal delivery or grocery delivery
*   Households that qualify may order three days of food at a time for up to a month. All orders will be delivered within three days of the order date. Each delivery will contain three days of food (9 meals per person, but no household will receive more than 18 meals per delivery).
*   To access, create an account at this website: [https://cv19engagementportal.cityofnewyork.us/#/display/5e7555117ad6750216160409](https://cv19engagementportal.cityofnewyork.us/#/display/5e7555117ad6750216160409), or call 3-1-1

#### NYC Region-Based Grocery Delivery

*   The City compiled a list of home delivery grocery options from local and national businesses. This directory is meant to identify options for New Yorkers to purchase fresh produce. The City of New York does not endorse the companies in the directory.
*   Note that customers may be responsible for the cost of groceries as well as delivery charges.
*   The list is available here: [https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/downloads/pdf/covid/Grocery%20Delivery%20Options.pdf](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/downloads/pdf/covid/Grocery%20Delivery%20Options.pdf)

#### Local mutual aid operations providing emergency food assistance
